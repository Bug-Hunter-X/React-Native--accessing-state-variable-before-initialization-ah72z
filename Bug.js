This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when using asynchronous operations within your React Native component. For example, fetching data from an API within the `useEffect` hook may result in trying to render the component before the data has been retrieved, resulting in the state variable being `undefined`. Another common scenario is accessing state within a nested component before the parent has fully mounted and passed down props.
